# Atlas Registry

[![Registry CI](https://github.com/atlas-registry/atlas/actions/workflows/lint-json.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/atlas-registry/atlas/actions/workflows/lint-json.yml)
[![Locales](https://img.shields.io/badge/locales-fr%20%7C%20en-blue)](#the-bilingual-guarantee)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)](./LICENSE)

The content source behind **[atlas.voidcorp.io](https://atlas.voidcorp.io)** — a French-language
library of AI prompts and guided interviews for founders and solo operators.

Everything is plain files in git. No CMS, no database, no admin panel. A pull request is the
editing interface, and the review is the quality gate.

## What is in here

| Resource | Count | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cartographies** | 1 | Guided interviews. Several turns, a shareable card, then a full report |
| **Prompts** | 33 | Single-shot templates with declared input variables |
| **Guides** | 21 | Long-form markdown articles |
| **Tools** | 22 | Curated AI tools. **Frozen** — see [scope](./CONTRIBUTING.md) |
| **Labels** | 35 | Closed vocabulary shared by every resource |

Every resource exists in **French and English**, and the CI refuses any change where the two
drift apart.

## How it works

```
content/            source of truth, reviewed in pull requests
   │
   │  npm run build
   ▼
*.fr.json           generated artifacts, committed to the repo
*.en.json
   │
   │  raw.githubusercontent.com
   ▼
atlas.voidcorp.io   validated again at build time against Zod schemas
```

The artifacts at the repository root are **generated**. Never edit them by hand — the CI compares
them against the source and fails when they disagree.

### The bilingual guarantee

Anything structural — identifiers, categories, labels, input variables, interview axes — is
declared **once**, in a locale-neutral file. Only display strings are translated.

This is not a stylistic preference. The site generates input forms from these declarations: two
diverging locales would produce two different forms depending on the reader's language. That class
of bug used to affect 14 prompts. It is now structurally impossible, and the CI proves it on every
pull request.

### Cartographies are not prompts

A prompt is a template with holes, filled in once. A **Cartographie** is an interview conducted
over several turns that produces two distinct artifacts: a card meant to be shared, then a
developed report.

It therefore carries three sets of instructions per language — conduct the interview, render the
card, write the report — because those are three separate model calls, not three sections of one
text. Turn ceilings and card axes are declared in metadata so that the cost of an interview is
bounded by construction rather than by convention.

## Consuming the data

The artifacts are served directly over `raw.githubusercontent.com`:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atlas-registry/atlas/refs/heads/main/prompts.fr.json
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atlas-registry/atlas/refs/heads/main/cartographies.en.json
```

Available resources: `prompts`, `cartographies`, `guides`, `tools`, `labels` — each in `.fr.json`
and `.en.json`.

**Stability contract.** Fields may be added; they are not removed and their types do not change
without coordination with the site. Treat the data as untrusted until you have validated it
against your own schema — that is what the site does.

## Working on the registry

Requires Node 20 or later.

```bash
npm install
npm run validate   # schemas, controlled vocabulary, locale parity
npm run build      # regenerate the JSON artifacts
npm run check      # both, plus artifact drift detection
```

```

  variables.mjs         input variables with their labels in both locales

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and **[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) is worth reading first** —
it states what Atlas accepts and what it does not, so you do not write a pull request for nothing.

The short version: Cartographies, prompts and guides are open. The tools catalogue is frozen.
Submitting your own product is allowed if you disclose it and accept the same bar as everyone else.
